## 🚀 Features

- 🪟 **VS Code Sidebar** — Dedicated sidebar panel with walkthrough controls, segment navigation, and live explanation display
- 🎯 **Code Highlighting** — Automatically opens files, scrolls to code, and highlights 1–8 line ranges with per-highlight explanations
- 🔊 **Local TTS** — Natural-sounding voice narration powered by Kokoro-82M (#1 ranked open-source TTS), running locally on Apple Silicon via mlx-audio
- 🎬 **Three Modes** — Walkthrough (hands-free with TTS), Read (text in terminal), or Podcast (single audio file)
- 🧠 **Adaptive Depth** — Overview or Deep Dive explanations based on your familiarity
- 📋 **Plan-First** — Scout finds files, planner builds narrative order, parallel segment agents generate highlights — outline visible immediately, segments stream in as they finish
- 💾 **Save & Share** — Save walkthroughs to `.walkthrough.json` files, replay later or share with teammates via the repo
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts** — Full keybinding support for hands-free navigation

## 📦 Requirements

- 🍎 macOS (Apple Silicon recommended for GPU-accelerated TTS)
- 🐍 Python 3.10+
- 📗 Node.js 18+
- 🖥️ VS Code or Cursor with CLI enabled (`code` or `cursor` command)

## 🔧 Installation

Just tell your coding agent:

```
Install the code explainer skill from https://github.com/Royal-lobster/code-explainer
```

Your agent will clone the repo into the skills directory, run `setup.sh`, and ask you to reload your editor — all while keeping you in the loop at each step.

<details>
<summary>📋 Manual installation</summary>

### Skill-native agents

These agents support the `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` format natively. Clone directly into the skills directory:

| Agent | Install commands |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Claude Code** | `git clone https://github.com/Royal-lobster/code-explainer.git ~/.claude/skills/explainer` |
| **Amp** | `git clone https://github.com/Royal-lobster/code-explainer.git ~/.config/agents/skills/explainer` |
| **OpenCode** | `git clone https://github.com/Royal-lobster/code-explainer.git ~/.config/opencode/skills/explainer` |
| **Codex CLI** | `git clone https://github.com/Royal-lobster/code-explainer.git ~/.codex/skills/explainer` |

Then run setup:

```bash
<SKILLS_DIR>/explainer/setup.sh
# Reload your editor: Cmd+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"
```

### Rule-based agents

These agents use their own rules/instructions format. Clone to any location, run setup, then point your agent's rules at the `SKILL.md`:

```bash
# 1. Clone to a shared location
git clone https://github.com/Royal-lobster/code-explainer.git ~/code-explainer

# 2. Run setup
~/code-explainer/setup.sh

# 3. Reload your editor: Cmd+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"
```

Then add a rule or instruction pointing to the skill:

| Agent | How to add |
|-------|------------|
| **Cursor** | Add a `.cursor/rules/explainer.mdc` file in your project that includes the contents of `SKILL.md` |
| **Windsurf** | Append the contents of `SKILL.md` to `~/.codeium/windsurf/memories/global_rules.md` |
| **Kilo Code** | Copy `SKILL.md` to `~/.kilocode/rules/explainer.md` |
| **Roo Code** | Copy `SKILL.md` to `~/.roo/rules/explainer.md` |
| **Cline** | Copy `SKILL.md` to your `.clinerules/explainer.md` directory |

> **Note:** The `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `docs/assess.md`), so the full repo must exist at the cloned location. For rule-based agents, ensure paths in the copied rules resolve correctly or use absolute paths.

### What setup.sh does

- 🐍 Python venv creation with TTS engine (mlx-audio + sounddevice)
- 🧩 VS Code extension build and installation (.vsix for VS Code + Cursor)
- 🗣️ Voice model download (~330 MB)
- 🔑 Script permissions

</details>

## 💬 Usage

In your coding agent:

```
/explainer the authentication system
```

Or naturally:

```
Explain how the matching engine works
Walk me through the order flow
How does the WebSocket gateway handle events?
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
1. 💬 You ask to explain a feature
2. 🎯 Asks your depth preference (Overview / Deep Dive) and delivery mode
3. 🔍 Scout sub-agent maps the codebase — discovers relevant files and call chain

Overview path (fast):
4. 📋 Single agent builds plan + highlights in one pass → sends set_plan

Deep Dive path (thorough):
4. 🗺️ Planner builds narrative order + transition objects
5. ⚡ Parallel segment agents generate dense highlights
   Waits for all agents to finish, then sends full set_plan to sidebar

6. ✅ Plan in sidebar + chat — approve, reorder, or skip before playback starts
7. 🔄 Walkthrough runs based on your chosen mode:
   Walkthrough — sidebar drives playback automatically with TTS narration
   Read        — step through explanations in terminal, highlights code as you go
   Podcast     — renders a single audio file of the entire walkthrough
8. 📝 Summarizes key takeaways
```

## 🎬 Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🎥 **Walkthrough** | Highlights move through code automatically while voice narrates in sync. Hands-free — just watch and listen. |
| 📝 **Read** | Text explanations in terminal. Highlights code, explains in text, waits for "next". No sidebar or TTS required. |
| 🎙️ **Podcast** | Generates a single audio file of the entire walkthrough. Listen anywhere. |

### 🪟 Sidebar Controls

The VS Code sidebar provides buttons for all walkthrough controls:

- ▶️ **Play / Pause** — Toggle walkthrough playback
- ⏭️ **Next / Previous** — Navigate between highlights within a segment
- ⏩ **Next / Previous Segment** — Jump between segments
- ⏩ **Speed** — Adjust TTS playback speed
- 🔈 **Volume** — Adjust TTS volume
- 🗣️ **Voice** — Select TTS voice
- 🔇 **Mute / Unmute** — Toggle voice narration
- 🔄 **Restart** — Restart walkthrough from the beginning
- 💾 **Save** — Save current walkthrough to `.walkthroughs/` for later replay
- ✕ **Close** — Close walkthrough (prompts to save if unsaved)

### 💾 Save & Share

Save walkthroughs as portable JSON files that live in your repo:

```bash
# Save via CLI
./scripts/explainer.sh save auth-flow

# Load a saved walkthrough
./scripts/explainer.sh load auth-flow

# List all saved walkthroughs
./scripts/explainer.sh list
```

Or use the VS Code command palette:
- **Code Explainer: Save Walkthrough** — Save with a custom name
- **Code Explainer: Load Walkthrough** — Browse and load saved walkthroughs

Saved walkthroughs are stored in `.walkthroughs/` at the workspace root with relative file paths, so teammates can pull them and replay on their own machine. The sidebar also shows a browse list of saved walkthroughs when no walkthrough is active.

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

All shortcuts are active when a walkthrough is running:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+Space` | Toggle play / pause |
| `Ctrl+Shift+]` | Next sub-segment |
| `Ctrl+Shift+[` | Previous sub-segment |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+]` | Next segment |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+[` | Previous segment |
| `Ctrl+Shift+\` | Stop walkthrough |
| `Ctrl+Shift+=` | Speed up TTS |
| `Ctrl+Shift+-` | Speed down TTS |

### 💬 Text Controls

You can also type commands in your agent's chat:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `next` | ⏭️ Move to next segment |
| `skip` | ⏩ Skip current segment |
| `skip to 4` | 🎯 Jump to segment 4 |
| `pause` | ⏸️ Pause walkthrough |
| `mute` / `unmute` | 🔇 Toggle voice narration |
| `stop` | ⏹️ End walkthrough |

## 🗣️ Voice Configuration

Code Explainer uses [Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) via [mlx-audio](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-audio) for high-quality local TTS. Falls back to macOS `say` if unavailable.

```bash
# Change voice
export TTS_VOICE=am_adam    # American male

# Change speed
export TTS_SPEED=1.2        # 20% faster
```

### 🎤 Available Voices

| Voice | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `af_heart` | 🇺🇸 American English, female (default) |
| `af_bella` | 🇺🇸 American English, female |
| `af_sarah` | 🇺🇸 American English, female |
| `am_adam` | 🇺🇸 American English, male |
| `am_michael` | 🇺🇸 American English, male |
| `bf_emma` | 🇬🇧 British English, female |
| `bm_george` | 🇬🇧 British English, male |

## 🏗️ Architecture

The extension runs an HTTP + WebSocket server on localhost for communication between your coding agent and the VS Code sidebar.

```
Coding Agent ──HTTP──▶ Extension Server ──Events──▶ Sidebar Webview
                           │                            │
                      Highlight API              TTS Audio Stream
                           │                            │
                     VS Code Editor              Browser AudioContext
```

### 🧩 Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🌐 **Extension Server** (`server.ts`) | HTTP + WebSocket server with bearer token auth. Endpoints for plan delivery, state queries, save/load, and long-polling user actions. |
| 🪟 **Sidebar** (`sidebar.ts`) | Webview panel showing the walkthrough — segment list, per-highlight explanations, and playback controls. |
| 🔄 **Walkthrough** (`walkthrough.ts`) | State machine managing segment and sub-highlight navigation and playback status. |
| 🎯 **Highlight** (`highlight.ts`) | Opens files, scrolls to ranges, and applies gold background decorations. |
| 🔊 **TTS Bridge** (`tts-bridge.ts`) | Streams audio from the Python TTS server to the sidebar webview via WebSocket. |
| 🐍 **TTS Server** (`tts_server.py`) | Persistent Python daemon that loads Kokoro once and streams audio over a Unix socket. |
| 💾 **Storage** (`storage.ts`) | Save and load walkthroughs as `.walkthrough.json` files for replay and sharing. |
| 📡 **Helper Script** (`explainer.sh`) | CLI wrapper around the HTTP API — used by the coding agent to send plans and poll for user actions. |
